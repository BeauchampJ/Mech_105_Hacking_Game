# Mech_105_Hacking_Game
This is a review game created by Jacob Beauchamp for Dr. Bechara's Mech 
105 course. This is a game that's meant to to be played as a way to review 
linux for the exam (with a little bit of Mech 105 content sprinkled in). 

# Setting the scene
Your name is Seth Wilson, a world renowned engineer and hacker. After 
graduating from Colorado State University you take up a very nice (and 
well paying job) with the United States Government. Each day you take on a 
mission to save the world, and todays mission just landed on your 
metaphorical desk.

# Todays Mission
Seth, a field agent was able to steal this computer file from a well known 
hacking group! We know you're the best for this job since the hacking 
group seem to dabble in not only linux but root finding algorithms as 
well!! Work your way through the files to disable the computer virus they 
plan on releasing on the world! You're our first and last hope!

# Getting started
Dr. Bechara has trained you well, enter the matrix and work your way 
through the files till you reach the killswitch! If you're ever stuck, 
reference Dr. Bechara's handy linux cheatsheet commands or go through past 
readme files! Good luck.
