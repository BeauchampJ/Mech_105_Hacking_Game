Wow! You made it into the matrix (that was even easier than swallowing a 
red pill). But this is where the fun really begins! There seem to be 4 
new folders in here. Which one is the right path to pick?!?! Fortunately 
for you, you find a clue on which path to take! See if you can answer this 
question to know what path to take!

Preform LU Decomposition of the following matrix (with pivoting)
A=[10 20;30 40]

What should our p matrix look like?

A. [1 1;1 1]
B. [0 1;1 0]
C. [1 0;0.33 1]
D. [1 0;0 1]
